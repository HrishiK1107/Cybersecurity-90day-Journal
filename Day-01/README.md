## Day 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity 

### Topics Discussed 

#### 1. **Introduction to Cyber Security**
- **Definition:** Cyber Security involves protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or interrupt normal business processes.
- **Importance:** It is vital for safeguarding data, maintaining trust, and ensuring the smooth operation of organizations and personal activities in a digital age.
- **Scope:** Cyber Security covers various domains, including network security, application security, information security, operational security, and disaster recovery.

#### 2. **Key Concepts**
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
-**Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data.
-**Availability:** Ensuring that information and resources are accessible to those who need them when they need them.

#### 3. **Types of Cyber Threats**
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device or network.
- **Phishing:** Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Eavesdropping attacks where the attacker intercepts and relays messages between two parties.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Attempts to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

#### 4. **Security Measures**

- **Firewalls:** Prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.
- **Encryption:** Protect data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Antivirus Software:** Detects and removes malicious software.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Requires multiple forms of verification to access a system.

#### 5. **Networking Concepts**
- **NAT (Network Address Translation):** A method used to remap one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):** A protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) that is recognized in the local network.
