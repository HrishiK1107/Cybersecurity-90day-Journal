# Cybersecurity Internship Resources-Repository

Welcome to the Cybersecurity Resources-Repository. This repository includes a curated collection of notes, commands, and tools essential for cybersecurity professionals. It will be continuously updated over the next 90 days to ensure you have access to the most current and relevant information. Stay informed and enhance your cybersecurity expertise with these valuable resources.

## Day 05: Exploring TryHackMe and Basic Penetration Testing
This repository serves as a log of the challenges I've completed, the knowledge I've gained, and the tools and techniques I've learned.

## Introduction to TryHackMe Platform

Today, we delved into the exciting world of TryHackMe, a platform designed to enhance cybersecurity skills through interactive learning. We began by creating a new profile on TryHackMe, which will be our hub for various cybersecurity challenges and learning modules.

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Profile

1. **Sign Up**: We started by signing up for a TryHackMe account. This was a straightforward process requiring an email and a password.
2. **Profile Setup**: After registration, we set up our profile, filling out necessary details and preferences.

### Exploring the Beginner Level

We explored the beginner-level challenges, focusing on the "Basic Penetration Testing" room. This module is designed to teach fundamental penetration testing skills through hands-on exercises.

## OWASP Top Ten

As part of our learning, we reviewed the OWASP Top Ten security risks. Here is a brief explanation of each:

1. **Broken Access Control**: When users can access data or perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to.
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Inadequate protection of sensitive data through weak encryption or poor key management.
3. **Injection**: When malicious data tricks the app into executing unintended commands.
4. **Insecure Design**: Lack of proper security measures in the design phase, leading to vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Incorrectly configured security settings that expose the system to attacks.
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Using software with known vulnerabilities due to outdated versions.
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Weaknesses in the login systems that allow unauthorized access.
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Using untrusted software or updates that compromise data integrity.
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Inadequate logging and monitoring, making it hard to detect breaches.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: When an attacker tricks the server into accessing internal resources.

## New Tools and Concepts

### SearchSploit

We were introduced to **SearchSploit**, a command-line tool included in Kali Linux that helps find known exploits and vulnerabilities for software. It is part of the Exploit Database (exploit-db.com) and is incredibly useful for penetration testing.

### CVE and CVSS

We explored the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** system and the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** on the [NIST website](https://nvd.nist.gov). CVE provides a standardized identifier for known vulnerabilities, while CVSS offers a scoring system to assess their severity.

### Exploit Database

Another valuable resource we discovered is the [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com), which houses a vast collection of exploits and vulnerabilities for various software.

## Basic Penetration Testing Skills

To prepare for the "Basic Penetration Testing" challenge, we learned about three key techniques:

1. **Brute Force**: Attempting multiple passwords or keys to gain unauthorized access.
2. **Hash Cracking**: Decoding hashed passwords to obtain the original text.
3. **Service Enumeration**: Identifying services running on a target system to find potential vulnerabilities.

## Practical Exercises

We practiced each of these techniques through hands-on exercises, gaining a deeper understanding of how they are applied in real-world scenarios.

## Introducing ngrok

### Downloading ngrok

We learned about **ngrok**, a tool that creates secure tunnels to localhost, making it accessible over the internet. Here's how to get started:

1. **Download ngrok**: Visit [ngrok's download page](https://ngrok.com/download) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
2. **Install ngrok**: Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

### Creating and Deploying index.html

We created a simple `index.html` file with the text "I'm from the ngrok". Here is the code for the HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ngrok Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I'm from the ngrok</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Deploying with ngrok
#### 1. Run a Local Server: Start a local server using a command like python -m http.server 8080.
#### 2. Expose the Server: Use ngrok to create a tunnel to the local server with the command ngrok http 8080.
#### 3. Access via Internet: ngrok provides a public URL that you can use to access your local server from the internet.
