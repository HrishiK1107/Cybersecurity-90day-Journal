## Day 3: Introduction to Windows 
This guide covers fundamental aspects of the Windows operating system relevant to cybersecurity, including access control, security features, command-line usage, and more.

### Topics Discussed 

#### 1. **Introduction to Windows**
Today, we explored the Windows operating system, its features,its relevance in cybersecurity and how Understanding Windows is crucial for both defending against and investigating cyber threats.

#### 2. **Access Control Types, Permissions, and UAC**

##### (i) **Access Control Types:**
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Controls access based on the identity of the requester and the ownership of the resource.
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Assigns access based on security labels assigned to each user and resource.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access is granted based on the roles users have within the system.

##### (ii) **Permissions:** Includes Read, Write, Execute, and Modify permissions for files and directories.

##### (iii) **User Account Control (UAC):** A security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system

#### 3. **Windows Firewall and Windows Defender**
- **Windows Firewall:** A built-in firewall that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- **Windows Defender:** An anti-malware component that provides real-time protection against software threats like viruses and spyware.

#### 4. **Windows Remote Management and RDP**
- **Windows Remote Management (WinRM):** A feature that allows administrators to remotely execute management tasks on Windows machines.
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that provides a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network.

#### 5. **Basic CMD Commands and Batch Scripting**
- **Basic CMD Commands:** 
  - **`dir`**: Lists directory contents.
  - **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.
  - **`copy`**: Copies files from one location to another.
  - **`del`**: Deletes one or more files.
  - **`echo`**: Displays messages or turns command echoing on or off.

- **Batch Scripting:** Writing scripts to automate tasks using CMD commands.

#### 6. **Introduction to PowerShell**
- **PowerShell:** A task automation framework consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language built on the .NET framework. It provides powerful features for system administration.

#### 7. **Using CMD and PowerShell for System Administration and Basic Security Tasks**
- **System Administration:** Managing users, processes, and services using CMD and PowerShell.
- **Basic Security Tasks:** Implementing security measures, checking system integrity, and monitoring for potential threats.

### Practical Experience

We were fortunate enough to witness a demonstration of how malware can affect a system and bypass Windows Defender. This included:
- **Understanding Malware Behavior:** Observing how malware operates and spreads within a system.
- **Bypassing Windows Defender:** Techniques used by malware to evade detection and mitigation by Windows Defender.
- It also highlights the need for robust incident response plans and security awareness training to effectively combat sophisticated cyber threats.
