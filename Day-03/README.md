## Day 3: Introduction to Windows 
This guide covers fundamental aspects of the Windows operating system relevant to cybersecurity, including access control, security features, command-line usage, and more.

### Topics Discussed 

#### 1. **Introduction to Windows**
Today, we explored the Windows operating system, its features,its relevance in cybersecurity and how Understanding Windows is crucial for both defending against and investigating cyber threats.

#### 2. **Access Control Types, Permissions, and UAC**

- ##### **Access Control Types:**
  - Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Controls access based on the identity of the requester and the ownership of the resource.
  - Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Assigns access based on security labels assigned to each user and resource.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access is granted based on the roles users have within the system.

- ##### **Permissions:** Includes Read, Write, Execute, and Modify permissions for files and directories.

- ##### **User Account Control (UAC):** A security feature that helps prevent unauthorized changes to the operating system

#### 3. **Windows Firewall and Windows Defender**
- **Windows Firewall:** A built-in firewall that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- **Windows Defender:** An anti-malware component that provides real-time protection against software threats like viruses and spyware.

#### 4. **Windows Remote Management and RDP**
- **Windows Remote Management (WinRM):** A feature that allows administrators to remotely execute management tasks on Windows machines.
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP):** A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that provides a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network.

#### 5. **Basic CMD Commands and Batch Scripting**
- **Basic CMD Commands:** 
  - **`dir`**: Lists directory contents.
  - **`cd`**: Changes the current directory.
  - **`copy`**: Copies files from one location to another.
  - **`del`**: Deletes one or more files.
  - **`echo`**: Displays messages or turns command echoing on or off.

- **Batch Scripting:** Writing scripts to automate tasks using CMD commands.

#### 6. **Introduction to PowerShell**
- **PowerShell:** A task automation framework consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language built on the .NET framework. It provides powerful features for system administration.

#### 7. **Using CMD and PowerShell for System Administration and Basic Security Tasks**
- **System Administration:** Managing users, processes, and services using CMD and PowerShell.
- **Basic Security Tasks:** Implementing security measures, checking system integrity, and monitoring for potential threats.


## Tool Used:
### SpiderTool
SpiderTool is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed for thorough web vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. It employs a robust set of scanning techniques to identify vulnerabilities in web applications, helping developers and security professionals mitigate potential risks effectively.

#### Key Features:
- **Comprehensive Scanning:** Detects a wide range of vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.
- **Customizable Tests:** Allows users to configure scans based on specific needs and security requirements.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generates detailed reports with actionable insights and remediation recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive dashboard and command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.
- **Active Community:** Supported by a vibrant community for updates, support, and collaboration.

## Practical Experience

We were fortunate enough to witness a demonstration of how malware can affect a system and bypass Windows Defender. This included:
- **Understanding Malware Behavior:** Observing how malware operates and spreads within a system.
- **Bypassing Windows Defender:** Techniques used by malware to evade detection and mitigation by Windows Defender.
- It also highlights the need for robust incident response plans and security awareness training to effectively combat sophisticated cyber threats.
